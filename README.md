# JS Promises

## Overview
You have to create a function that returns the power of the provided number after 2 seconds using promises.

## Instructions

1. Create a function called `power`.
2. The function should accept an argument (num), and return a promise.
3. if the argument (num) is not a number, the promise should return the following error `the input is not a number`.
4. The promise should resolve itself after 2 seconds providing the power of the `num` (num * num).
5. call the `power` function and use await to resolve it.
6. invoke the function with a number and log the result.
7. invoke the function with a string and log the error.
